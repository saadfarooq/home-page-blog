## Introduction
This post is about the significant points and arguments I found in Andrea diSessa's book `Changing
Minds`.

## Things for Meeting
* Discuss the comparison of computational literacy hierarchy with other literacy hierarchy
* Computational literacy is unique in that the content created is consumed in a different way i.e. With language literacy:
  - Literary actions: reading / writing
  - Creation action : writing
  - Consumption action : reading
With computation literacy
  - Literary actions: reading / writing code
  - Creation: write "code"
  - Consumption: read "code" / consume application
* More like scientific literacy
* Can you pay for my CSTA-13 registration ?
* The World of Functions as a Function
* Designing event based languages on the argument that they are more intuivitive.

## Research Questions
* Is teaching the "everything is a function philosophy" worth it ?
* How much harder is it in comparison ?
* Can it be a literacy extendable to arts who don't necessarily understand that they are doing math?
 * What do kids instinctively know, what can be elaborated on to make it clear and what has to be taught anew ?
 * Can this philosophy be compatible with state based computational approaches? for e.g. programming a robot.

## Notes
* The tick model provides a good analogy to calculus i.e. looking at unit step intervals that make up a larger process (process is not the correct word)
* Lambda calculus provides a better mapping to algebra in my opinion.
* The notational significance of the _dx/dy_ notation vs Newton's notation is emphasized. Seems to the be the most common example.
* Scientific communities are tool-rich cultures. Education does not seem to be.
* Algebra, calculus, tables are representational tools.
* Tools are abandoned as better tools come to forth. 
* Tools in schoool tend be an end in thomselves and are related to outcomes like "doing well in school"
* Need to understand _p-prims_ better.
* _Half a literacy is not enough_ to be revisited
