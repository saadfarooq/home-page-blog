# Library to Use
[PHPExcel](http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/) is the most comprehensive Excel manipulation library for PHP. I has great features for reading and manipulating Excel (and related) files. 

I found a number of extensions written for Yii that claim to work. I didn't think any of them gave the complete array of features and some were just using PHPExcel in the background anyway.
