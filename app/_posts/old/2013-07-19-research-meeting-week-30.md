# Todos for Week 30
- Look into the relation between concurrent programming and functional programming
- Teaching of functional programming: connection between functional programming and mathematics
- Figure out timelines etc. for IRB and scopes

# More Information
- There is a workshop called "Trends in Functional Programming in Education" that might be of future interest. It's being held at Brigham Young University in Utah this year [link](http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~holzenspiespkf/TFPIE2013.html)
