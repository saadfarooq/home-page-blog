Following is a list of professors who's work I found interesting and inspiring. I am particularly interested in the understanding of computer science / programming concepts so a lot of the research here will be lower level education research.

## Mark Guzdial, Georgia Tech [page](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~guzdial/)
Mark is the sun of the CSEd solar system. He's been involved in just about everything to do with Computer science education. Currently, his work is more around the public policy aspect but he writes a very influential [blog](http://computinged.wordpress.com) which is a great resource for anyone who's interested in computer science education.

## Moti Ben-Ari, Weizmann Institute of Science - Israel [page](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/)
I like Ben-Ari's work. He deals with a lot of the lower level understanding of computer science concepts / educational theories for computer science. Some of his interesting papers are:
- [Constructivism in Computer Science Education](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=274308)

## Michael E Casperson, Aarhus University - Denmark [page](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mec/)
Micheal seems deeply involved with [WiPSCE](http://wipsce.org/), a workshop in primary and secondary computing education.

## Neil B Dale, University of Texas
Two PhD thesis under here guidance seem pretty relevant.

 - Conceptual Models and Individual Cognitive Learning Styles in Teaching Recursion to Novices, Cheng-Chih Wu, 1993
 - Limitations in the Understanding of Mathematical Logic by Novice Computer Science Students,Vicki Lynn Almstrum, 1994.

There is also a paper by her in SIGCSE, title [Most difficult topics in CS1: results of an online survey of educators](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1138403.1138432&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=234525748&CFTOKEN=55092647) which sounds really interesting.

## Allison Elliot Tew, University of Washington, Tacoma
Language Independent Assessment of CS1
Scaffolding Research in Computer Science Education
Not cognitive enough but better than most CS specific researchers.
[Presentation](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/events/conf/2006/icer/icer-talks/2006-icer-guzdial-tew.ppt) from ICER 2006.

## 	Vicki L. Almstrum, UTexas at Austin
[Import and export to/from computing science education: the case of mathematics education research](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=544414.544471&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=234525748&CFTOKEN=55092647)
I think I'm in love

## Colin Johnson
Will have to investigate more but he is part of the computer science education group at the University of Kent and his research interests include porting ideas from computing and mathematics to other areas and taking ideas from natural sciences and using them as metaphors for new ways of doing computing.

## J Philip East, Northwestern University

## Janet Kolodoner, Georgia Tech

## Rosario Vera Ruiz
From IES Jarifa Spain, this researcher published a paper in the 'Internation Journal of Technology in Mathematics Education' title 'Teaching the Relevance of Mathematics in Information Technology through Functional Programming in Secondary School'.
This sounds exactly in line with the sort of research questions I have. Unfortunately, the remainder of his work appears to be in English.
## Peter Achten, Nijmegen Institute for Computing and Information Sciences
His primary area of research seems to be functional programming. However, he has an exciting program called [`Soccer-Fun`](http://www.cs.ru.nl/P.Achten/SoccerFun/SoccerFun.html) which is a framework for programming a soccer team using functional languages. The framework is used to teach functional programming.


## Micheal Kolling, University of Kent
BlueJ / Greenfoot author.

## Philip Guo, Google
Not particularly relevant as a CSEd researcher but is pretty active in general HCI and wrote the Online Python Tutor.
